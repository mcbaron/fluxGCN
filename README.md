Graph Convolutional Networks in Flux
====

Flux.jl implementation of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for semi-supervised classification [1].

For a high-level introduction to GCNs, see:

Thomas Kipf, [Graph Convolutional Networks](http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) (2016)

Note: There are subtle differences between the TensorFlow implementation in https://github.com/tkipf/gcn and this Flux.jl re-implementation. This re-implementation serves as a proof of concept and is not intended for reproduction of the results reported in [1].

This implementation makes use of the Cora dataset from [2].

## Installation

```python setup.py install```

## Requirements

  * Flux 
  * Julia 1.1

## Usage

```julia train.jl```
